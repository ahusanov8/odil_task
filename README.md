# QA Engineer Homework

### 1. Theoritical Part

***a. Product Quality Control***

You are in charge of product quality control for brand new action camera.
The camera is rated to be water resistant for up to 100m, up to 15m vertical fall and guaranteed
battery life of 10 hours standby time or 4 hours filming time.
The camera has a power button, shutter button and mode switch button, which toggles between
video and still image capture.
Please write a test plan with at least 15 items, each consisting of a test description,

#### Deliverables
* Find Test cases written in excel

---
### 2. Practical Part

#### Assigments 
Complete the algorithms discussed below. You can write these in whichever language you feel most comfortable with. Each implementation should have enough unit tests to cover all cases.

* a. Write an implementation of Bubble Sort.
* b. Write an implementation of an alphanumeric sort. In this case, we should sort numbers first, followed by lowercase letters, uppercase letters and then all other characters. The special case here is that if any two numerical characters are next to each other, then they will be treated as one numeric value. The following example has a sample input with the expected output.
Example: Input -> ‘A11a4’ Output -> ‘411aA’

***Instructions for Implementation of Assignments*** 

#### Bubble sort
* It is called bubble sort, because the small numbers "bubble" to the top of the list. The general flow is to step through the list, continually comparing pairs of numbers. If the number on the left is larger than the number on the right, swap them and continue.
* Find implementation in bubble_sort.py python file : 
    * a function called bubble_sort()
    * This function will take in a list as an argument
    * This function will return a sorted list using the bubble sort algorithm


#### Alphanumeric sort
